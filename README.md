# 📖 In the Beginning: The Lion of Judah

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And in these latter days, there came forth a testament of honor unto the Lion of Judah, a sacred website fashioned in the icy realms, to glorify and magnify a beloved godmother who walketh in the strength and grace of the lion. And behold, the spirit of Christmas hath also descended upon it, bringing forth celebration and joy in the midst of the winter season.
